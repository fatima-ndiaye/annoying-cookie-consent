## Overview

### Description

The modal mimics a typical cookie consent message that appears on websites, but with added annoyances and twists. Users must fill in their name and email in order to close the modal, and the buttons switch places whenever the mouse hovers over the "Decline" button. After entering personal information, a loading animation appears with the message "Making the Sale," followed by a personalized message with the user's name and the message "We just sold the rights to your eternal soul.

## Features

- The modal cannot be closed without filling in the name and email fields
- Two buttons "Accept" and "Decline", but whenever the mouse hovers over the "Decline" button, it switches places with the "Accept" button
- After entering personal information, a second message appears with an animation loading and the message "Making the Sale"
- A final personalized message appears with your name and the message "We just sold the rights to your eternal soul."
